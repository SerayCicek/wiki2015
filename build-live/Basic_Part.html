<p>A <strong>basic part</strong> is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into
smaller component parts.
<a href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051">BBa_R0051</a> is an example
of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.</p>
<p>Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick
parts. Thus, there are <strong>many</strong> opportunities to find new, cool, and important
genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these
functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.</p>
