<h2 id="collaborations">Collaborations</h2>
<p>Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out
and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve
together.</p>
<h4 id="which-other-teams-can-we-work-with-">Which other teams can we work with?</h4>
<p>You can work with any other team in the competition, including software,
hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research
groups, but they do not count towards the <a href="http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#Medals">iGEM team collaboration gold medal
criterion</a>.</p>
<p>In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must
complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM
team.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the function of another team&#39;s BioBrick Part or Device</li>
<li>Characterize another team&#39;s part</li>
<li>Debug a construct</li>
<li>Model or simulating another team&#39;s system</li>
<li>Test another team&#39;s software</li>
<li>Help build and test another team&#39;s hardware project</li>
<li>Mentor a high-school team</li>
</ul>
